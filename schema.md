- **Relationships**:
    - MusicBrainz:
        - *WORKED_IN*: *Artist* to *Track*. Its inverse is *WORKED_BY*.
        - *WORKED_BY*.
        - *COLLAB_WITH*: *Artist* to *Artist*. Its inverse is itself.
            - `count`: Number of collaborations.
        - *MUSICALLY_RELATED_TO*: *Artist* to *Artist*. Its inverse is itself.
            - `count`: Number of times that an entity of artist a was musically related to an entity of artist b in MusicBrainz's DB.
            - Relationship types 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 305, 728, 855 and 965 in MB's DB.
        - *PERSONALLY_RELATED_TO*: *Artist* to *Artist*. Its inverse is itself.

        - *HAS_TAG*: *Artist* or *Track* to *Tag*. Its inverse is *TAGS*.
        - *TAGS*.

All relationships/edges have a `pg_weight` field:

```cypher
MATCH ()-[r]->()
SET r.pg_weight = CASE
    WHEN r.weight IS NOT NULL THEN r.weight
    WHEN r.count IS NOT NULL THEN r.count
    ELSE 1
END
```
