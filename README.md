# MusicBrainz database study

This repository serves as a way of working with multiple computers and as a way of showing my work to the professor that guides me.

## Contents

- `study.ipynb`: Summary of all I've been learning/working on. It's supposed to work with a `.env` file that describes how to connect to a valid MusicBrainz database server.

## Dependencies

A working python environment with the following:

```
psycopg2 pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib python-dotenv notebook
```

Use conda, pip... Whatever. Example:

```bash
conda create -n foo psycopg2 pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib python-dotenv notebook
```

## LICENSE

No license right now as I don't know if this work can be exposed to the public at the moment of writing this README.
