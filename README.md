# MusicBrainz database study

This repository serves as a way of working with multiple computers and as a way of showing my work to the professor that guides me.

## .env file

A .env file is needed in order to configure the database connection. An example .env file is provided. Modify its contents to satisfy your needs.

## Contents

They must be executed in the following order (the subitems are the files generated by the notebook):

- `recordings_and_releases.ipynb`: Summary of all I've been learning/working on about `recordings` and `releases`, as well of the needed code to extract CSVs and some graphs.
    - `recordings-*.csv`, * being from 1 to 5.
    - `releases-*.csv`, * being from 1 to 5.
- `genres.ipynb`: Shows that genres are impossible to extract via MusicBrainz. At least I can't find the way at the moment.
- `various_artists_cleanup.py`: Script that merges the releases CSVs while removing the artist with ID 1 ("Various Artists").
    - `releases_no_va.csv`
- `artist_artist.ipynb`: Shows how to generate CSVs containing information on relationships between artists and how to merge different instances of the same artist.
    - `artists.jsonl`
    - `relationships.csv`
    - `releases_no_va_merged.csv`
- `relationships_cleanup.py`: Generates a version of the relationships CSV without duplicates.
    - `relationships_clean.csv`
- `lastfm.ipynb`: Shows how we can use [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/)'s API and extract the information that holds.
- `add_id_final_releases_csv.py`: Generates an id column to `releases_no_va_merged.csv` and modifies the data so that Neo4j won't complain.
    - `releases_no_va_merged_id.csv`
- `neo4j_import.py`: Imports our current dataset into a [Neo4j database](https://neo4j.com/).

## Dependencies

A working python environment with the following:

```
psycopg2 pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib python-dotenv notebook networkx
```

Use conda, pip... Whatever. Example:

```bash
conda create -n foo psycopg2 pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib python-dotenv notebook networkx
```

## Database installation

I followed [this link](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Server/Setup), section **Setup from source code**. In theory you can install the database without the web server but I didn't want to mess up by skipping a crucial step by accident. The web server installation is very fast, unlike the database installation, so I recommend doing it that way.

## LICENSE

No license right now as I don't know if this work can be exposed to the public at the moment of writing this README.
