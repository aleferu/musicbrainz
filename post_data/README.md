# post_data

Explains how we got the dataset for the MLP and has some scripts and notebooks to compute and graph some stats.

- `build_ds_mlp.py` gets all the pt tensors for all MB+LFM combos.
- `get_more_ds_mlp.ipynb` gets the rest.
- `clean_attrs.py` and `year_month_id_track.py` helps creating some attrs that later helps extracting the datasets out of the DB.
- The others are just stats and graphs.
